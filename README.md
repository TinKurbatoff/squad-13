# The 13th Squad

**The 13th Squad** is my entry for 2024's [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/).
The theme for the competition was **triskaidekaphobia** (fear of the number 13).

The game is inspired by the helicopter game, [Rashlander](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054270/RASHLANDER/), and Metal Gear Solid V.

The goal of the game is to maneuver your helicopter throughout a series of levels. Make it to the landing zone without crashing!

You can play the game at http://chopper.tap2play.io/

## Build

make install

# License

Feel free to read the code but don't use it for commercial purposes. The game is the result of a lot of hard work and I wish to maintain all rights to it.
